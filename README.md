## About the Course  
This course covers the fundamental concepts of PyTorch and its practical applications, including data preprocessing, tensors, gradient calculation, backpropagation, regression, classification, 
fundamentals of statistics and linear algebra, model evaluation and improvement, as well as best project practices.  <br/>
Since the course lectures and labs are in English, I chose to keep all code in the same language.

## Repository Structure  
The Jupyter notebook files are organized by modules, according to the course:
```
📁 Repository structure
├── 📁 Module 1 - Tensors and Datasets
├── 📁 Module 2 - Linear regression
├── 📁 Module 3 - Regression Pytorch way (Gradients)
├── 📁 Module 4 - Multiple Linear Regression
├── 📁 Module 5 - Logistic Regression
├── 📁 Module 6 - Final project
│   ├── 📝 Final Project - League of Legends Match Predictor 
├── README.md 
```

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**
- **PyTorch** 
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## Final Projects  
The three final projects of the course are in the **Module 6** folder.  
They demonstrate the application of concepts learned throughout the course, including the best techniques and approaches taught by IBM instructors.

## How to Use  
1. Clone and access the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/phaa/ibm-intro-pytorch.git
   cd ibm-intro-pytorch/
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment (conda or venv):
   ```bash
   conda activate ibmenv
   ```
3. Run the notebooks in Jupyter lab:  
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```
*Each notebook has a cell to install the necessary dependencies.* 

## Contributions  
This repository is a record of the course learning, but suggestions and improvements are always welcome!
